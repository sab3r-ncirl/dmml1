Evaluation Methods (10%. Max 100 words. Brief description of proposed methods  to evaluate chosen machine learning method)

Regression:
MSE/RMSE
MAE
R-squared/Adjusted R-squared

Classification:
Accuracy cannot be used as the dataset is highly imbalanced.
So methods like confusion matrix and Precision/Recall, F1 statistics will be used to evaluate the model.
